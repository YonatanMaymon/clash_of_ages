the game is an age of war like game

the game will be competitive (1 vs 1, instead of player vs computer): 
the game should have steady progress (between games)

the game achives that by having a clash royal like upgrade system:
start with simple unit in each age and add more through chests 
upgradable units, can get upgrades through chests 

vary strong units in particular age (gained by chests) can add another layer to the game design, incentivizing the player to strategize on leveling up 
can add more incentives to level up, contradicting with the prior incentive not to level up (like faster money gain, more hp, more upgrades) 

deck system
there is a fixed amount of playable cards for each era, the player will biuld a deck before hand 
this adds another layer of strategy, you might strategies your deck to have more tower defenders in one age, and more units on another

maybe add a rock paper scissors mechanic, (mele win ranged, ranged win heavy, heavy win mele) 

rune system, from chests or leveling up, the player gain runes-
runes are upgrades with whom the player may get special bonuses for eras  

if game is entering a stalemate, start loosing hp for both castles, and money gain increase
